Issue:
    Unable to negotiate with legacyhost: no matching key exchange method found.
    Their offer: diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
Cause:
    In this case, the client and server were unable to agree on the key exchange algorithm.
    The server offered only a single method diffie-hellman-group1-sha1.
    OpenSSH supports this method, but does not enable it by default because it is weak and within theoretical range of the so-called Logjam attack.
Solution:
    ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 user@legacyhost
